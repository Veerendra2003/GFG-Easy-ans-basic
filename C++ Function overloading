Gurkaran is fascinated by how can we know the exact volume of some objects just by knowing some of their dimensions but he does not actually know how it actually works. Can you help him find the volume of a cube, a cylinder, and a rectangular box?

Note: Invest time in studying the locked code.

Take the value of pie = 3.14159
Example:

Input:

3

1 2

2 1 2

3 1 2 3

Output:

8
6.29038
6
Input:

First line contains the number of test cases and each test case has a single line query where in each query first integer denotes if the object given is a cube, cylinder, or box and the remaining integer in the query denotes object's dimension.

1:- represents a cube

2 :-  represents a cylinder

3 :- represents a rectangular box

All the integer values in a query are space separated.

Output:

The output should consist of a single integer or double value (depending upon the object) which depicts the volume of that object.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100

0 <= dimensions <= 100

first number in a query = {1, 2, 3} */
