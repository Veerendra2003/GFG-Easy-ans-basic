Given two lists V1 and V2 of sizes n and m respectively. Return the list of elements common to both the lists and return the list in sorted order. Duplicates may be there in the output list.

Example:

Input:
n = 5
v1[] = {3, 4, 2, 2, 4}
m = 4
v2[] = {3, 2, 2, 7}
Output:
2 2 3
Explanation:
The common elements in sorted order are {2 2 3}
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You need to complete the function common_element that takes both the lists as parameters and returns a list of common elements.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
1 ≤ Vi ≤ 105

SOLUTION IN JAVA:
------------------
class Solution {

    public long minValue(long a[], long b[], long n) 
    {
        // Your code goes here
        Arrays.sort(a);
        Arrays.sort(b);
        long min = 0;
        for(long i=0,j=n-1; i<n; i++,j--)
        {
            min = min + a[i]*b[j];
        }
        return min;
    }
}
